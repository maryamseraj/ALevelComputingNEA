My A Level Computing NEA, scoring 70/75. I created an investment management system that also calculates the return on an investment (ROI) using a neural network with inputs such as market growth rate and profit. I built the system using C# and ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL and Microsoft Azure.
